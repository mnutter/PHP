				<h3>Introduction</h3>
				<p>
				We are pleased to announce the opening of the UCSD Behavioral Testing Core (BTC) in spring 2013 under the direction of Charles Heyser, PhD.  As part of the Department of Neurosciences, the BTC  provides state-of-the-art behavioral testing and phenotypic screening of mice and rats across all ages of development. 
				Mouse experiment.  We offer a large array of well-validated neurobehavioral assessment tools relevant to rodent models of cognitive and neurodegenerative disorders as well as disorders of social interaction. These tools provide a unique platform for the screening and profiling of experimental therapeutics and genetic rodent models.

In addition to providing a centralized resource for experimental procedures to evaluate cognition and sensorimotor function, our goal is to collaborate with academic laboratories, non-profit foundations, and pharmaceutical/biotech companies worldwide.

We believe that by acting in collaboration, we will be able to contribute to our understanding of memory and cognition and complex human CNS disorders including (but limited to): stroke, spinal cord injury, Alzheimer’s disease, Down syndrome, Huntington’s disease, ALS, Autism Spectrum Disorder, and Schizophrenia.
